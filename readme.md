# Hackerati Full Stack Coding Challenge

This is a web app I built to complete the Hackerati [Full-Stack coding challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDUDj2siKOHo6vGit5LAVnvNEqxC_3N3IdHmBIP6mpE/edit). The assignment was to built a system to collect data that is generated on an interval (once a minute/hour/day/etc). Store in a database; record time and data value. Then build a web app that displays a graph of the collected data with your choice of intervals. Add a table report of the data with column headings. The table should be placed below the graph.
